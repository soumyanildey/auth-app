## Password Reset Flow

- Encrypted tokenized reset (email and SMS flows)
- Expiring links (15-min window for security)
- Branded, HTML email templates with instructions
- Rate limiting and robust token invalidation
- One-time, secure usage per reset

## Database Models

- **User**: Email, password (hashed), phone, TOTP/SMS status, roles, status, profile photo, security logs
- **PasswordResetToken**: User, token, created/expiry times, usage flag
- **EmailOTP**: User, email, OTP, attempt tracking, expiry
- **PasswordHistory**: User, hash, change date (enforces non-reuse for last 10)
- **SMS OTP (cached)**: Phone, OTP, cooldown/expiry (via Redis cache)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django 5+, Django REST Framework 3+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16+ (Dockerized)
- **Cache**: Redis 7+ (Dockerized)
- **Authentication**: JWT (rotation, refresh)
- **MFA**: pyotp, qrcode (Google Authenticator, SMS OTP)
- **Testing**: Full automated suite (>70 security/unit tests)

## Frontend Features

- Responsive, modern dashboard and settings pages
- Secure and clear user flows for registration, recovery, profile edits, and MFA
- Account status monitoring and real-time UI updates
- Profile photo upload and live preview
- Animated transitions, interactive validation, and in-app notifications
- Comprehensive security feedback and locked account protection
- Uniform navigation and layout throughout pages

## Testing

**To run all security/unit tests:**
```bash
python run_security_tests_optimized.py
```
> Covers authentication, lockout, 2FA, OTPs (email and SMS), permissions, and more.
> All SMS features are fully covered by passing security tests.

## Resources

- [API Documentation: /api/docs/](http://localhost:8000/api/docs/)
- [Admin Panel: /admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/)
- Frontend pages: `/static/dashboard.html`, `/static/profile.html`, `/static/security.html`

## Roadmap

- OAuth2 / Single-Sign-On (Google, Microsoft, SAML)
- Analytics dashboard (usage, security trends)
- Dark mode UX

**Note:**
All secrets, API credentials, and sensitive config should be stored in `.env`. Never commit sensitive data to source control.

**SecureAuth** delivers robust, multi-factor enterprise authentication with a complete SMS OTP implementation, production security, and extensible dashboards—ready for deployment or further extension in any environment.
